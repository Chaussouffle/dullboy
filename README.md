A work in progress page of the dullboy project.


Philosophy of the project : 
The dullboy is an attempt to correct ergonomic issues I personnaly had with OLKB's Planck :
Which implies : 
Lowered pinkies ; 
30% keyboard ;
Low-profile (Choc V1) ;
Nice!Nano (BLE) ;
Cirque Trackpad.


Without giving up what I loved with the Planck project : 
Unmatched portability ;
Smol (if I may say) ;
Ortholinear board.

Layout : 
3x 12 +6
Thought initially for 34 keys, who can do more can do less, the 34 cases are here to have the optimal layout, you may adapt your keymap to ignore blanck spaces.

This project is sollely build for my purpose and an attempt to reach my ideal of an elegant and confortable daily board. 
That being said : 
Every files in this repository is free of use, you may take appart every single file to build your own and are very welcome to build your own dullboy if it suits you. 
I am more than pleased if this project reach another one than myself, even if it isn't the purpose of it.


I take gladly every feedback one may provide and can rework stuff if requested (and if it suits me)


Will include the following : 


A proper READ ME
dullboy's pcb : 
dullboy36c (dullboy, 36 keys, Cirque trackpad).


3D model of dullboy's case :
dullboy36c case ;
dullboy36 case ;
dullboy34c case ;
dullboy34 case.


Keymap examples : 
QMK base - suited for Planck
ZMK - ERGO-L rearranged (french - english - code)
ZMK - QWERTY rearranged (standard layout that you want to drop for ANY other one. Like, really.)
